# Hi there.
Welcome! I'm Aliya Reich, the Program Assistant for Conferences and Events at the [Digital Library Federation](https://www.diglib.org), a project of the [Council on Library and Information Resources](https://www.clir.org).

# Re-telling the Story of the DLF Forum
This is a site to house my work for Mozilla's Open Leaders 7 (Cohort E, Spring 2019), where I'll be focusing on how to re-envision the story of the Digital Library Federation's DLF Forum, pushing the event to be even more open and inclusive to a wider variety of communities beyond who's currently being served.

# Vision Statement
I’m working with the Digital Library Federation community to strengthen the story of openness and inclusivity at the annual DLF Forum so that all invested in the success of libraries, museums, and archives can feel welcome and find a place of their own at this event and in this community. I’m working open to make DLF’s offerings clear and available to a wider audience and to help with collaborations and outreach to other communities.
