# DLF-Forum-OL7
This is a repo for my work as part of Mozilla's Open Leaders 7 (Cohort E), where I'll be focusing on how to push the Digital Library Federation's DLF Forum to be even more open and inclusive.

# Vision Statement
I’m working with the Digital Library Federation community to strengthen the story of openness and inclusivity at the annual DLF Forum so that all invested in the success of libraries, museums, and archives can feel welcome and find a place of their own at this event and in this community. I’m working open to make DLF’s offerings clear and available to a wider audience and to help with collaborations and outreach to other communities.
